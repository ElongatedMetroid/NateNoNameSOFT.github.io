Linux is better than windows because it runs on all of the worlds supercomputers and 95% of the worlds servers. On Linux you also never have to restart, 
you can even update your computer while it is running. Linux is also more secure unlike windows, were windows allows the government to track all your data 
and sell your data. All you need is the CLI and it is the most customizable DE, it is also free and open source. It's great for server management and 
everything. Linux is also so good and stable that it runs on the ISS (international space station).You are in control of your computer with Linux, Unlike 
where on Windows there in control of you.
