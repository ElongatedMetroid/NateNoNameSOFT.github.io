First of the bat, Apple has terrible business practices such as anti-competitive behavior, use of sweatshop labor, lying about MANY MANY things, and 
unsecure devices. They also heavily artificially limit their users on what they can do with their OWN devices even though they pay thousands of dollars for 
an Apple device. One thing Apple lies about is there phones being very safe, there not even close, do there operating systems closed source nature, the community
can't help find dangerous security vulnerability, and we can see with the open-source operating system Linux, Linux is very secure and that is why the government
uses it. You also may think you have control of your device, but you really don't, Apple is in control of your device and they can see everything you do at every
second.
