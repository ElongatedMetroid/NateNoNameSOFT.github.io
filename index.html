			Linux is better than windows because it runs on all of the worlds supercomputers and 95% of the worlds servers. On Linux you also never have to restart, 
			you can even update your computer while it is running. Linux is also more secure unlike windows, were windows allows the government to track all your data 
			and sell your data. All you need is the CLI and it is the most customizable DE, it is also free and open source. It's great for server management and 
			everything. You are in control of your computer with Linux, Unlike where on Windows there in control of you.

			First of the bat, Apple has terrible business practices such as anti-competitive behavior, use of sweatshop labor, lying about MANY MANY things, and 
			unsecure devices. They also heavily artificially limit their users on what they can do with their OWN devices even though they pay thousands of dollars for 
			an Apple device. One thing Apple lies about is there phones being very safe, there not even close, do there operating systems closed source nature, the community
			can't help find dangerous security vulnerability, and we can see with the open-source operating system Linux, Linux is very secure and that is why the government
			uses it. You also may think you have control of your device, but you really don't, Apple is in control of your device and they can see everything you do at every
			second.
